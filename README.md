# EstariaCampaign

## To Do

- [ ] Directly edit HTML files to include working "Back to Dashboard" button (<button onclick="window.location.href = 'https://andrewme89.github.io/EstariaCampaign/';">Go to Website</button>)
- [ ] Update Template files to include button for future additions
- [ ] See if Leaflet functionality remains in HTML export
- [ ] If above works, ask Shelby for the map and some info as to where the party has been for map pins

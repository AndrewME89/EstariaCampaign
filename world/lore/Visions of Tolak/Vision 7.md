You are standing in a throne room you look to your left and see a king though he looks a little fizzy to you. 

The king speaks he says “Sir my apologies about your farm land and the queen and I will do everything we can to help you” 

You here the peasant responds “Oh thank you your grace” as he exits the chamber

You see the king turn towards his pale grey eyes staring at you with a sternness before he’s face softens as he lets out a loud chuckle. 

You what his stand and exit as you hear a loud crash and everything goes black as a white-hot pain rocket through your body

You seem to be in a garden staring up at the blue sky, you can feel the soft grass and the warm wind on your skin. 

You look up at a pink and gold bedroom and sit up. 

Then the sky goes red you look up and see a bright ball of fire heading your way. 

You scream as loud as you can, you sound like a child. You take off running towards a castle and you can feel the wet tears streaming down your face. 

Then everything goes white and a white-hot pain rockets through your body

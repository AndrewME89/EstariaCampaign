You are standing shorter than you expected. Looking out at military soldiers training. 

Swords are being swung and one of the soldiers managed to knock the other off their feet. 

You hear yourself speak “Good work Alexander! King Dotah will be pleased with your progress” 

The young soldier beams at you and continues training. You feel yourself smile and look up at the sky as it starts to turn red. 

You panic and look around and spot someone you seemed to be looking for. 

It’s a young boy not older than 10 in noble robes and a small crown. 

He panics and stands running towards a castle. "Prince-"

You feel yourself get cut off as a red-hot pain shoots through your body. And you wake up.
